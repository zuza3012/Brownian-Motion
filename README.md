Simulation of the Brownian Motions in a liquid

Program allows to see the Brownian Motions of a single particle in a liquid in 2 and 3 dimentions.

Brownian motion is the random motion of particles suspended in a fluid (a liquid or a gas) resulting from their collision with the fast moving molecules in the fluid (using Wiener process).

In physics the Wiener process is used to study Brownian motion, the diffusion of minute particles suspended in fluid, and other types of diffusion via the Fokkerâ€“Planck and Langevin equations. It also forms the basis for the rigorous path integral formulation of quantum mechanics and the study of eternal inflation in physical cosmology.
